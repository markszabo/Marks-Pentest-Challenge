      <h1>Welcome!</h1>
Very warm welcome again my fellow hacker! 
<br>Since you have succesfully solved my challenges, I want to make you an offer. I have the following files on my webserver, but I just forgot my password. <br><br>
<img src="pics/files.jpg" width="600px"><br><br>
But I remember, that I have some websites running on the server (see the list below). Can you access those files and tell me the content? If yes, you will be generously rewarded.<br>
All of these websites are from the corresponding projects website and there are a lot of tutorials and walk-through. If you are really stuck, search for the solutions of one, try to understand and then try to solve an other one on your own.<br>
Although solving only these challenges will not get you the above mentioned files. You have to figure that out for yourself. But if you do, the reward will be yours. I only ask you to provide a detailed description of how you did it, and allow me to publish it on my <a href="http://eittrento.blogspot.com/" target="_blank">blog</a> (under your choosen name/nickname of course). And given that I can not print money (yet), I want to limit the number of rewards for one per person, so you have to choose if you got more.

<h2><a href="">Advanced level: OWASP Hackademic Challenges Project, but with Snort</a></h2>
It is the same webapp as before, but Snort IDS is used to protect it. But can you fool it?<br>
